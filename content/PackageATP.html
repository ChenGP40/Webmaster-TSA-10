	<div>
		"Amongst the Planets" offers a two-week-long journey on Horizen’s very own ship, the Stargazer. 
		The trip features stops at each of the eight planets within the solar system. 
		"Amongst the Planets" is available bimonthly at varying dates. 
		So, leave the globe trotting behind and join Horizon on a trip through the stars!<br/>
		See the day-to-day itinerary below:

	</div><br/><br/>
	<div style="font-weight: normal; border: #BDD4DE 3px dashed;">
		Day 1: Board the luxurious Stargazer and prepare for a trip beyond your wildest imagination. 
		At 9:00 AM (according to UTC-3), the Stargazer will launch until reaching the orbiting point. 
		Travelers will spend the day enjoying the view of the planet Earth and partaking in some Earthly traditions from around the world. 
		11 PM marks the end of the day for each day of the cruise as all passengers must enter hypersleep to allow the Stargazer to continue on to the next planet.<br/><br/>

		Day 2: It is a hot day on the Stargazer as the ship arrives at Mercury. 
		The Stargazer will orbit Mercury for the day, offering travelers a view of its beautiful surface and some much-needed relaxation time in the heat. 
		The Stargazer's tanning salon will be open, along with our zero-gravity space beach.<br/><br/>

		Day 3: Things have gotten cooler, but it's still pretty hot at Venus. 
		It's another day of enjoying the Stargazer's "Summer in Space" activities. 
		Visit our on-ship shopping center for cool planet merchandise and loads of fun!<br/><br/> 

		Day 4: Watch as the Stargazer orbits Mars. 
		Art exhibits, historical presentations, and more will be available throughout the day. 
		Visit our "Touch and Feel" exhibit to experience real Martian objects that were obtained by Mars rover expeditions. 
		For guests who love the supernatural: plan on attending our 9 PM alien story exhibit!<br/><br/> 

		Day 5: Welcome to Jupiter, the first of the gas giants.
		Today, you'll get to see the famous Jupiter storm spot, one of the trip's must-see highlights. 
		All of the regular viewing and lounge options will be available every day for the rest of the trip. 
		Additionally, planet specific family activities will be run hourly by Stargazer workers.<br/><br/> 

		Day 6: See Saturn in its full glory as the Stargazer orbits the planets and skates along its rings.<br/><br/> 

		Day 7: Things have gotten cold. Enjoy the frosty view of Uranus, the 7th planet from the Sun. 
		The Stargazer's "Winter in Space" activities open today and will remain open until 10:00 PM the next day. 
		Try some Galaxy-class Ice Cream as well!<br/><br/> 

		Day 8: If you haven’t purchased your authentic Neptune diamonds yet, today is the day. 
		Enjoy the view of Neptune and participate in various Neptune-related activities throughout the day.<br/><br/>  

		Days 9 through 14: The Stargazer will make its way back to all the planets we have visited on a wonderful journey back home. 
		Attend the Solar Spectacular on Day 13 at 6 PM to enjoy our party in the stars as the trip comes to a close.
		On Day 14, the ship will begin the 20-minute reentry process at 6:30 PM for arrival on Earth at 7 PM. 
		At 6 PM, Stargazer personnel will patrol the ship and ensure every guest is ready for re-entry.
