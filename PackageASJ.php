	</div>
	<div>
		"A Stellar Journey" is a four week long trip on Horizon's most state-of-the-art ship, the Agro. 
		During this trip, you will leave our little solar system behind and venture into our neighboring galaxy Andromeda. 
		The schedule for the first week will mirror that of our shorter voyage "Amongst the Planets." 
		In the second week, however, travelers break through the Milky Way and arrive at Andromeda where the ship will explore for five days before making the eight-day trip back home.<br/> 
		See the day-to-day itinerary below:
	</div><br/><br/>
	<div style="font-weight: normal; border: #BDD4DE 3px dashed;">
		Day 1: Board the spectacular Agro and prepare for a trip beyond your wildest imagination. 
		At 9:00 AM (according to UTC-3), the Argo will launch until reaching the orbiting point. 
		Travelers will spend the day enjoying the view of the planet Earth and partaking in some Earthly traditions from around the world. 
		11 PM marks the end of the day for each day of the cruise as all passengers must enter hypersleep to allow the Argo to continue on to the next planet.<br/><br/>

		Day 2: It is a hot day on the Argo as the ship arrives at Mercury. 
		The Argo will orbit Mercury for the day, offering travelers a view of its beautiful surface and some much-needed relaxation time in the heat. 
		The Argo's tanning salon will be open, along with our zero-gravity space beach.<br/><br/>

		Day 3: Things have gotten cooler, but it's still pretty hot at Venus. 
		It's another day of enjoying the Argo's "Summer in Space" activities. 
		Visit our on-ship shopping center for cool planet merchandise and loads of fun!<br/><br/> 

		Day 4: Watch as the Argo orbits Mars. 
		Art exhibits, historical presentations, and more will be available throughout the day. 
		Visit our "Touch and Feel" exhibit to experience real Martian objects that were obtained by Mars rover expeditions. 
		For guests who love the supernatural: plan on attending our 9 PM alien story exhibit!<br/><br/> 

		Day 5: Welcome to Jupiter, the first of the gas giants.
		Today, you'll get to see the famous Jupiter storm spot, one of the trip's must-see highlights. 
		All of the regular viewing and lounge options will be available every day for the rest of the trip. 
		Additionally, planet specific family activities will be run hourly by Argo workers.<br/><br/> 

		Day 6: See Saturn in its full glory as the Argo orbits the planets and skates along its rings.<br/><br/> 

		Day 7: Things have gotten cold. Enjoy the frosty view of Uranus, the 7th planet from the Sun. 
		The Argo's "Winter in Space" activities open today and will remain open until 10:00 PM the next day. 
		Try some Galaxy-class Ice Cream as well!<br/><br/> 

		Day 8: If you haven’t purchased your authentic Neptune diamonds yet, today is the day. 
		Enjoy the view of Neptune and participate in various Neptune-related activities throughout the day.<br/><br/>

		Day 9: A full day of hypersleep for the journey to Andromeda.<br/><br/>
		
		Days 10 through 14: Explore the wonders of Andromeda in a unique experience unlike any other. 
		See PA-99-N2 and undertake space discoveries and observations on your own.<br/><br/>

		Day 15: Re-enter a full day of hypersleep for reentry into the Milky Way.<br/><br/>

		Days 16 through 21: Experience the planets from earlier in our journey all over again as the Agro makes its way back to Earth. 
		All passengers will be prepared for reentry to Earth at 6 PM, and the process will begin at 6:30 PM. Arrival time is estimated at 7 PM.
