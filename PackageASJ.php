		"A Stellar Journey" is a four week long trip on Horizon's most state-of-the-art ship, the Agro. 
		During this trip, you will leave our little solar system behind and venture into our neighboring galaxy Andromeda. 
		The schedule for the first week will mirror that of our shorter voyage "Amongst the Planets." 
		In the second week, however, travelers break through the Milky Way and arrive at Andromeda where the ship will explore for five days before making the eight-day trip back home.<br/> 
		See the day-to-day itinerary below:

		Day 1: Board the spectacular Agro and prepare for a trip beyond your wildest imagination. 
		At 9:00 AM (according to UTC-3), the Argo will launch until reaching the orbiting point. 
		Travelers will spend the day enjoying the view of the planet Earth and partaking in some Earthly traditions from around the world. 
		11 PM marks the end of the day for each day of the cruise as all passengers must enter hypersleep to allow the Argo to continue on to the next planet.<br/><br/>

		Day 2: It is a hot day on the Argo as the ship arrives at Mercury. 
		The Argo will orbit Mercury for the day, offering travelers a view of its beautiful surface and some much-needed relaxation time in the heat. 
		The Argo's tanning salon will be open, along with our zero-gravity space beach.<br/><br/>

		Day 3: Things have gotten cooler, but it's still pretty hot at Venus. 
		It's another day of enjoying the Argo's "Summer in Space" activities. 
		Visit our on-ship shopping center for cool planet merchandise and loads of fun!<br/><br/> 

		Day 4: Watch as the Argo orbits Mars. 
		Art exhibits, historical presentations, and more will be available throughout the day. 
		Visit our "Touch and Feel" exhibit to experience real Martian objects that were obtained by Mars rover expeditions. 
		For guests who love the supernatural: plan on attending our 9 PM alien story exhibit!<br/><br/> 

		Day 5: Welcome to Jupiter, the first of the gas giants.
		Today, you'll get to see the famous Jupiter storm spot, one of the trip's must-see highlights. 
		All of the regular viewing and lounge options will be available every day for the rest of the trip. 
		Additionally, planet specific family activities will be run hourly by Argo workers.<br/><br/> 

		Day 6: See Saturn in its full glory as the Argo orbits the planets and skates along its rings.<br/><br/>
