	<div style="font-weight: normal; border: #BDD4DE 3px dashed">
		Day 1: Board the esteemed Voyager and prepare for a trip of a lifetime. 
		At 9:00 AM (according to UTC-3), the Voyager will launch until reaching the orbiting point. 
		Onlookers will be able to see both North and South America upon arrival. 
		Throughout the day, enjoy viewing the world from above as the Voyage orbits the planet. 
		At mealtime, try some of the Voyager’s five-star rated gourmet restaurants — it’s out of this world!<br/><br/>
		
		Day 2: The viewing lounge is still a great place to relax. 
		However, if you're looking for something new, Day 2 on the Voyager has much to offer. 
		From 10 AM to 9 PM, Voyager Space Rangers will be teaching a variety of amazing lessons about the planet Earth and space exploration, offering immersive and informative experiences fit for all ages.
		You can also make a reservation for the zero-gravity room, which is open from 9 AM to 8 PM, to simulate the conditions of outer space.<br/><br/>

		Day 3: It’s celebration day! 
		While you can still enjoy all of the previously mentioned amenities, Day 3 on Voyager brings the opportunity for an entirely new experience: Global exploration from space. 
		The viewing lounge will be hosting region-specific celebrations and festivities in accordance with the areas of the world in sight! 
		Try specially made regional space cuisine or play some interesting, authentic games. The sky's the limit — or perhaps we should say space!<br/><br/>

		Day 4: It is time to fit in any last-minute activities, regardless of if it is something new or a repeat experience, because it's almost time to go home! 
		The ship will begin the 20-minute reentry process at 6:30 PM for arrival on Earth at 7 PM. At 6 PM, Voyager personnel will patrol the ship and ensure every guest is ready for re-entry.
